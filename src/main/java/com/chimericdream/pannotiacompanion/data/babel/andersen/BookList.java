            "People said \"The Evening Bell is sounding, the sun is setting.\" For a strange wondrous tone was heard in the narrow streets of a large town. It was like the sound of a church-bell: but it was only heard for a moment, for the rolling of the",
            "carriages and the voices of the multitude made too great a noise. Those persons who were walking outside the town, where the houses were farther apart, with gardens or little fields between them, could see the evening sky still better, and",
            "heard the sound of the bell much more distinctly. It was as if the tones came from a church in the still forest; people looked thitherward, and felt their minds attuned most solemnly. A long time passed, and people said to each other--\"I wonder if",
            "there is a church out in the wood? The bell has a tone that is wondrous sweet; let us stroll thither, and examine the matter nearer.\" And the rich people drove out, and the poor walked, but the way seemed strangely long to them; and when they came to a",
            "clump of willows which grew on the skirts of the forest, they sat down, and looked up at the long branches, and fancied they were now in the depth of the green wood. The confectioner of the town came out, and set up his booth there; and soon",
            "after came another confectioner, who hung a bell over his stand, as a sign or ornament, but it had no clapper, and it was tarred over to preserve it from the rain. When all the people returned home, they said it had been very romantic, and that it was",
            "quite a different sort of thing to a pic-nic or tea-party. There were three persons who asserted they had penetrated to the end of the forest, and that they had always heard the wonderful sounds of the bell, but it had seemed to them as if it had come",
            "from the town. One wrote a whole poem about it, and said the bell sounded like the voice of a mother to a good dear child, and that no melody was sweeter than the tones of the bell. The king of the country was also observant of it, and vowed that he who",
            "could discover whence the sounds proceeded, should have the title of \"Universal Bell-ringer,\" even if it were not really a bell. Many persons now went to the wood, for the sake of getting the place, but one only returned with a sort of",
            "explanation; for nobody went far enough, that one not further than the others. However, he said that the sound proceeded from a very large owl, in a hollow tree; a sort of learned owl, that continually knocked its head against the branches. But",
            "whether the sound came from his head or from the hollow tree, that no one could say with certainty. So now he got the place of \"Universal Bell-ringer,\" and wrote yearly a short treatise \"On the Owl\"; but everybody was just as wise as before. It was the",
            "day of confirmation. The clergyman had spoken so touchingly, the children who were confirmed had been greatly moved; it was an eventful day for them; from children they become all at once grown-up-persons; it was as if their",
            "infant souls were now to fly all at once into persons with more understanding. The sun was shining gloriously; the children that had been confirmed went out of the town; and from the wood was borne towards them the sounds of the unknown bell with",
            "wonderful distinctness. They all immediately felt a wish to go thither; all except three. One of them had to go home to try on a ball-dress; for it was just the dress and the ball which had caused her to be confirmed this time, for otherwise she",
            "would not have come; the other was a poor boy, who had borrowed his coat and boots to be confirmed in from the innkeeper's son, and he was to give them back by a certain hour; the third said that he never went to a strange place if his parents were not",
            "with him--that he had always been a good boy hitherto, and would still be so now that he was confirmed, and that one ought not to laugh at him for it: the others, however, did make fun of him, after all. There were three, therefore, that did not go; the",
            "others hastened on. The sun shone, the birds sang, and the children sang too, and each held the other by the hand; for as yet they had none of them any high office, and were all of equal rank in the eye of God. But two of the youngest soon grew tired,",
            "and both returned to town; two little girls sat down, and twined garlands, so they did not go either; and when the others reached the willow-tree, where the confectioner was, they said, \"Now we are there! In reality the bell does not exist; it is only",
            "a fancy that people have taken into their heads!\" At the same moment the bell sounded deep in the wood, so clear and solemnly that five or six determined to penetrate somewhat further. It was so thick, and the foliage so dense, that it was quite",
            "fatiguing to proceed. Woodroof and anemonies grew almost too high; blooming convolvuluses and blackberry-bushes hung in long garlands from tree to tree, where the nightingale sang and the sunbeams were playing: it was",
            "very beautiful, but it was no place for girls to go; their clothes would get so torn. Large blocks of stone lay there, overgrown with moss of every color; the fresh spring bubbled forth, and made a strange gurgling sound. \"That surely cannot be the",
            "bell,\" said one of the children, lying down and listening. \"This must be looked to.\" So he remained, and let the others go on without him. They afterwards came to a little house, made of branches and the bark of trees; a large wild apple-tree bent over",
            "it, as if it would shower down all its blessings on the roof, where roses were blooming. The long stems twined round the gable, on which there hung a small bell. Was it that which people had heard? Yes, everybody was unanimous on the subject, except",
            "one, who said that the bell was too small and too fine to be heard at so great a distance, and besides it was very different tones to those that could move a human heart in such a manner. It was a king's son who spoke; whereon the others said, \"Such",
            "people always want to be wiser than everybody else.\" They now let him go on alone; and as he went, his breast was filled more and more with the forest solitude; but he still heard the little bell with which the others were so satisfied, and now and",
            "then, when the wind blew, he could also hear the people singing who were sitting at tea where the confectioner had his tent; but the deep sound of the bell rose louder; it was almost as if an organ were accompanying it, and the tones came from the left",
            "hand, the side where the heart is placed. A rustling was heard in the bushes, and a little boy stood before the King's Son, a boy in wooden shoes, and with so short a jacket that one could see what long wrists he had. Both knew each other: the boy was",
            "that one among the children who could not come because he had to go home and return his jacket and boots to the innkeeper's son. This he had done, and was now going on in wooden shoes and in his humble dress, for the bell sounded with so deep a tone,",
            "and with such strange power, that proceed he must. \"Why, then, we can go together,\" said the King's Son. But the poor child that had been confirmed was quite ashamed; he looked at his wooden shoes, pulled at the short sleeves of his jacket, and said",
            "that he was afraid he could not walk so fast; besides, he thought that the bell must be looked for to the right; for that was the place where all sorts of beautiful things were to be found. \"But there we shall not meet,\" said the King's Son, nodding at",
            "the same time to the poor boy, who went into the darkest, thickest part of the wood, where thorns tore his humble dress, and scratched his face and hands and feet till they bled. The King's Son got some scratches too; but the sun shone on",
            "his path, and it is him that we will follow, for he was an excellent and resolute youth. \"I must and will find the bell,\" said he, \"even if I am obliged to go to the end of the world.\" The ugly apes sat upon the trees, and grinned. \"Shall we thrash",
            "him?\" said they. \"Shall we thrash him? He is the son of a king!\" But on he went, without being disheartened, deeper and deeper into the wood, where the most wonderful flowers were growing. There stood white lilies with blood-red stamina, skyblue tulips,",
            "which shone as they waved in the winds, and apple-trees, the apples of which looked exactly like large soapbubbles: so only think how the trees must have sparkled in the sunshine! Around the nicest green meads, where the deer were playing in the",
            "grass, grew magnificent oaks and beeches; and if the bark of one of the trees was cracked, there grass and long creeping plants grew in the crevices. And there were large calm lakes there too, in which white swans were swimming, and beat the air with",
            "their wings. The King's Son often stood still and listened. He thought the bell sounded from the depths of these still lakes; but then he remarked again that the tone proceeded not from there, but farther off, from out the depths of the forest. The sun",
            "now set: the atmosphere glowed like fire. It was still in the woods, so very still; and he fell on his knees, sung his evening hymn, and said: \"I cannot find what I seek; the sun is going down, and night is coming--the dark, dark night. Yet perhaps I",
            "may be able once more to see the round red sun before he entirely disappears. I will climb up yonder rock.\" And he seized hold of the creeping-plants, and the roots of trees--climbed up the moist stones where the water-snakes",
            "were writhing and the toads were croaking--and he gained the summit before the sun had quite gone down. How magnificent was the sight from this height! The sea--the great, the glorious sea, that dashed its long waves against the coast--was",
            "stretched out before him. And yonder, where sea and sky meet, stood the sun, like a large shining altar, all melted together in the most glowing colors. And the wood and the sea sang a song of rejoicing, and his heart sang with the rest: all nature",
            "was a vast holy church, in which the trees and the buoyant clouds were the pillars, flowers and grass the velvet carpeting, and heaven itself the large cupola. The red colors above faded away as the sun vanished, but a million stars were",
            "lighted, a million lamps shone; and the King's Son spread out his arms towards heaven, and wood, and sea; when at the same moment, coming by a path to the right, appeared, in his wooden shoes and jacket, the poor boy who had been confirmed with",
            "him. He had followed his own path, and had reached the spot just as soon as the son of the king had done. They ran towards each other, and stood together hand in hand in the vast church of nature and of poetry, while over them sounded the",
            "invisible holy bell: blessed spirits floated around them, and lifted up their voices in a rejoicing hallelujah!"

            "Ah! yes, that was little Tuk: in reality his name was not Tuk, but that was what he called himself before he could speak plain: he meant it for Charles, and it is all well enough if one does but know it. He had now to take care of his little sister",
            "Augusta, who was much younger than himself, and he was, besides, to learn his lesson at the same time; but these two things would not do together at all. There sat the poor little fellow, with his sister on his lap, and he sang to her all the songs he",
            "knew; and he glanced the while from time to time into the geography-book that lay open before him. By the next morning he was to have learnt all the towns in Zealand by heart, and to know about them all that is possible to be known. His mother now",
            "came home, for she had been out, and took little Augusta on her arm. Tuk ran quickly to the window, and read so eagerly that he pretty nearly read his eyes out; for it got darker and darker, but his mother had no money to buy a candle. \"There goes the",
            "old washerwoman over the way,\" said his mother, as she looked out of the window. \"The poor woman can hardly drag herself along, and she must now drag the pail home from the fountain. Be a good boy, Tukey, and run across and help the old",
            "woman, won't you?\" So Tuk ran over quickly and helped her; but when he came back again into the room it was quite dark, and as to a light, there was no thought of such a thing. He was now to go to bed; that was an old turn-up bedstead; in it he lay and",
            "thought about his geography lesson, and of Zealand, and of all that his master had told him. He ought, to be sure, to have read over his lesson again, but that, you know, he could not do. He therefore put his geography-book under his pillow,",
            "because he had heard that was a very good thing to do when one wants to learn one's lesson; but one cannot, however, rely upon it entirely. Well, there he lay, and thought and thought, and all at once it was just as if someone kissed his eyes and",
            "mouth: he slept, and yet he did not sleep; it was as though the old washerwoman gazed on him with her mild eyes and said, \"It were a great sin if you were not to know your lesson tomorrow morning. You have aided me, I therefore will now help you; and",
            "the loving God will do so at all times.\" And all of a sudden the book under Tuk's pillow began scraping and scratching. \"Kickery-ki! kluk! kluk! kluk!\"--that was an old hen who came creeping along, and she was from Kjoge. \"I am a Kjoger hen,\" said she,",
            "and then she related how many inhabitants there were there, and about the battle that had taken place, and which, after all, was hardly worth talking about. \"Kribledy, krabledy--plump!\" down fell somebody: it was a wooden bird, the popinjay used",
            "at the shooting-matches at Prastoe. Now he said that there were just as many inhabitants as he had nails in his body; and he was very proud. \"Thorwaldsen lived almost next door to me. Plump! Here I lie capitally.\" But little Tuk was no longer",
            "lying down: all at once he was on horseback. On he went at full gallop, still galloping on and on. A knight with a gleaming plume, and most magnificently dressed, held him before him on the horse, and thus they rode through the wood to the old",
            "town of Bordingborg, and that was a large and very lively town. High towers rose from the castle of the king, and the brightness of many candles streamed from all the windows; within was dance and song, and King Waldemar and the young,",
            "richly-attired maids of honor danced together. The morn now came; and as soon as the sun appeared, the whole town and the king's palace crumbled together, and one tower after the other; and at last only a single one remained standing",
            "where the castle had been before, and the town was so small and poor, and the school boys came along with their books under their arms, and said, \"2000 inhabitants!\" but that was not true, for there were not so many. And little Tukey lay in his bed: it",
            "seemed to him as if he dreamed, and yet as if he were not dreaming; however, somebody was close beside him. \"Little Tukey! Little Tukey!\" cried someone near. It was a seaman, quite a little personage, so little as if he were a midshipman; but a",
            "midshipman it was not. \"Many remembrances from Corsor. That is a town that is just rising into importance; a lively town that has steam-boats and stagecoaches: formerly people called it ugly, but that is no longer true. I lie on the sea,\" said",

            "then, too, I smell so deliciously, for close before the gate bloom the most beautiful roses.\" Little Tuk looked, and all was red and green before his eyes; but as soon as the confusion of colors was somewhat over, all of a sudden there appeared a",
            "wooded slope close to the bay, and high up above stood a magnificent old church, with two high pointed towers. From out the hill-side spouted fountains in thick streams of water, so that there was a continual splashing; and close beside them sat an",
            "old king with a golden crown upon his white head: that was King Hroar, near the fountains, close to the town of Roeskilde, as it is now called. And up the slope into the old church went all the kings and queens of Denmark, hand in hand, all with their",
            "golden crowns; and the organ played and the fountains rustled. Little Tuk saw all, heard all. \"Do not forget the diet,\" said King Hroar. Again all suddenly disappeared. Yes, and whither? It seemed to him just as if one turned over a leaf in a book. And",
            "now stood there an old peasant-woman, who came from Soroe, where grass grows in the market-place. She had an old grey linen apron hanging over her head and back: it was so wet, it certainly must have been raining. \"Yes, that it has,\" said",
            "she; and she now related many pretty things out of Holberg's comedies, and about Waldemar and Absalon; but all at once she cowered together, and her head began shaking backwards and forwards, and she looked as she were going to make a",
            "spring. \"Croak! croak!\" said she. \"It is wet, it is wet; there is such a pleasant deathlike stillness in Sorbe!\" She was now suddenly a frog, \"Croak\"; and now she was an old woman. \"One must dress according to the weather,\" said she. \"It is wet; it is",
            "wet. My town is just like a bottle; and one gets in by the neck, and by the neck one must get out again! In former times I had the finest fish, and now I have fresh rosy-cheeked boys at the bottom of the bottle, who learn wisdom, Hebrew, Greek--Croak!\"",
            "When she spoke it sounded just like the noise of frogs, or as if one walked with great boots over a moor; always the same tone, so uniform and so tiring that little Tuk fell into a good sound sleep, which, by the bye, could not do him any harm. But even",
            "in this sleep there came a dream, or whatever else it was: his little sister Augusta, she with the blue eyes and the fair curling hair, was suddenly a tall, beautiful girl, and without having wings was yet able to fly; and she now flew over",
            "Zealand--over the green woods and the blue lakes. \"Do you hear the cock crow, Tukey? Cock-a-doodle-doo! The cocks are flying up from Kjoge! You will have a farm-yard, so large, oh! so very large! You will suffer neither hunger nor",
            "thirst! You will get on in the world! You will be a rich and happy man! Your house will exalt itself like King Waldemar's tower, and will be richly decorated with marble statues, like that at Prastoe. You understand what I mean. Your name shall",
            "circulate with renown all round the earth, like unto the ship that was to have sailed from Corsor; and in Roeskilde--\" \"Do not forget the diet!\" said King Hroar. \"Then you will speak well and wisely, little Tukey; and when at last you sink into your",
            "grave, you shall sleep as quietly--\" \"As if I lay in Soroe,\" said Tuk, awaking. It was bright day, and he was now quite unable to call to mind his dream; that, however, was not at all necessary, for one may not know what the future will bring. And out",
            "of bed he jumped, and read in his book, and now all at once he knew his whole lesson. And the old washerwoman popped her head in at the door, nodded to him friendly, and said, \"Thanks, many thanks, my good child, for your help! May the good",

            "the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new clothes. He had a different suit for each hour of the day; and as of any other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say, \"he is sitting in council,\" it was always said of him, \"The",
            "Emperor is sitting in his wardrobe.\" Time passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; strangers arrived every day at the court. One day, two rogues, calling themselves weavers, made their appearance. They gave out that they knew how to",
            "weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held, or who was extraordinarily simple in",
            "character. \"These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!\" thought the Emperor. \"Had I such a suit, I might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit for their office, and also be able to distinguish the wise from the foolish! This stuff must be woven",
            "for me immediately.\" And he caused large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly. So the two pretended weavers set up two looms, and affected to work very busily, though in reality they did",
            "nothing at all. They asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold thread; put both into their own knapsacks; and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms until late at night. \"I should like to know how the weavers are getting on",
            "with my cloth,\" said the Emperor to himself, after some little time had elapsed; he was, however, rather embarrassed, when he remembered that a simpleton, or one unfit for his office, would be unable to see the manufacture. To be sure, he thought",
            "he had nothing to risk in his own person; but yet, he would prefer sending somebody else, to bring him intelligence about the weavers, and their work, before he troubled himself in the affair. All the people throughout the city had heard of the",
            "wonderful property the cloth was to possess; and all were anxious to learn how wise, or how ignorant, their neighbors might prove to be. \"I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers,\" said the Emperor at last, after some",
            "deliberation, \"he will be best able to see how the cloth looks; for he is a man of sense, and no one can be more suitable for his office than he is.\" So the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were working with all their might,",
            "at their empty looms. \"What can be the meaning of this?\" thought the old man, opening his eyes very wide. \"I cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms.\" However, he did not express his thoughts aloud. The impostors requested him very",
            "courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms; and then asked him whether the design pleased him, and whether the colors were not very beautiful; at the same time pointing to the empty frames. The poor old minister looked and",
            "looked, he could not discover anything on the looms, for a very good reason, viz: there was nothing there. \"What!\" thought he again. \"Is it possible that I am a simpleton? I have never thought so myself; and no one must know it now if I am so. Can it",
            "be, that I am unfit for my office? No, that must not be said either. I will never confess that I could not see the stuff.\" \"Well, Sir Minister!\" said one of the knaves, still pretending to work. \"You do not say whether the stuff pleases you.\" \"Oh,",
            "it is excellent!\" replied the old minister, looking at the loom through his spectacles. \"This pattern, and the colors, yes, I will tell the Emperor without delay, how very beautiful I think them.\" \"We shall be much obliged to you,\" said the",
            "impostors, and then they named the different colors and described the pattern of the pretended stuff. The old minister listened attentively to their words, in order that he might repeat them to the Emperor; and then the knaves asked for more",
            "silk and gold, saying that it was necessary to complete what they had begun. However, they put all that was given them into their knapsacks; and continued to work with as much apparent diligence as before at their empty looms. The Emperor now sent",
            "another officer of his court to see how the men were getting on, and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready. It was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister; he surveyed the looms on all sides, but could see nothing at all but",
            "the empty frames. \"Does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you, as it did to my lord the minister?\" asked the impostors of the Emperor's second ambassador; at the same time making the same gestures as before, and talking of the design and colors",
            "which were not there. \"I certainly am not stupid!\" thought the messenger. \"It must be, that I am not fit for my good, profitable office! That is very odd; however, no one shall know anything about it.\" And accordingly he praised the stuff",
            "he could not see, and declared that he was delighted with both colors and patterns. \"Indeed, please your Imperial Majesty,\" said he to his sovereign when he returned, \"the cloth which the weavers are preparing is extraordinarily magnificent.\" The",
            "whole city was talking of the splendid cloth which the Emperor had ordered to be woven at his own expense. And now the Emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture, while it was still in the loom. Accompanied by a select number of officers of",
            "the court, among whom were the two honest men who had already admired the cloth, he went to the crafty impostors, who, as soon as they were aware of the Emperor's approach, went on working more diligently than ever; although they",

            "glorious colors!\" and at the same time they pointed to the empty frames; for they imagined that everyone else could see this exquisite piece of workmanship. \"How is this?\" said the Emperor to himself. \"I can see nothing! This is indeed a",
            "terrible affair! Am I a simpleton, or am I unfit to be an Emperor? That would be the worst thing that could happen--Oh! the cloth is charming,\" said he, aloud. \"It has my complete approbation.\" And he smiled most graciously, and",
            "looked closely at the empty looms; for on no account would he say that he could not see what two of the officers of his court had praised so much. All his retinue now strained their eyes, hoping to discover something on the looms, but they could see no",
            "more than the others; nevertheless, they all exclaimed, \"Oh, how beautiful!\" and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material, for the approaching procession. \"Magnificent!",
            "Charming! Excellent!\" resounded on all sides; and everyone was uncommonly gay. The Emperor shared in the general satisfaction; and presented the impostors with the riband of an order of knighthood, to be worn in their button-holes, and",
            "the title of \"Gentlemen Weavers.\" The rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take place, and had sixteen lights burning, so that everyone might see how anxious they were to finish the Emperor's new",

            "before; I am Night; I saw thy tears whilst thou sang'st them!\" \"I will sing them all, all!\" said the mother. \"But do not stop me now--I may overtake him--I may find my child!\" But Night stood still and mute. Then the mother wrung her hands, sang and",
            "wept, and there were many songs, but yet many more tears; and then Night said, \"Go to the right, into the dark pine forest; thither I saw Death take his way with thy little child!\" The roads crossed each other in the depths of the forest, and she no",
            "longer knew whither she should go! then there stood a thorn-bush; there was neither leaf nor flower on it, it was also in the cold winter season, and ice-flakes hung on the branches. \"Hast thou not seen Death go past with my little child?\" said the",
            "mother. \"Yes,\" said the thorn-bush; \"but I will not tell thee which way he took, unless thou wilt first warm me up at thy heart. I am freezing to death; I shall become a lump of ice!\" And she pressed the thorn-bush to her breast, so firmly, that it",
            "might be thoroughly warmed, and the thorns went right into her flesh, and her blood flowed in large drops, but the thornbush shot forth fresh green leaves, and there came flowers on it in the cold winter night, the heart of the afflicted mother was so",
            "warm; and the thorn-bush told her the way she should go. She then came to a large lake, where there was neither ship nor boat. The lake was not frozen sufficiently to bear her; neither was it open, nor low enough that she could wade through it; and",
            "across it she must go if she would find her child! Then she lay down to drink up the lake, and that was an impossibility for a human being, but the afflicted mother thought that a miracle might happen nevertheless. \"Oh, what would I not give to come to",
            "my child!\" said the weeping mother; and she wept still more, and her eyes sunk down in the depths of the waters, and became two precious pearls; but the water bore her up, as if she sat in a swing, and she flew in the rocking waves to the shore on the",
            "opposite side, where there stood a mile-broad, strange house, one knew not if it were a mountain with forests and caverns, or if it were built up; but the poor mother could not see it; she had wept her eyes out. \"Where shall I find Death, who took away",
            "my little child?\" said she. \"He has not come here yet!\" said the old grave woman, who was appointed to look after Death's great greenhouse! \"How have you been able to find the way hither? And who has helped you?\" \"OUR LORD has helped me,\" said she. \"He",
            "is merciful, and you will also be so! Where shall I find my little child?\" \"Nay, I know not,\" said the woman, \"and you cannot see! Many flowers and trees have withered this night; Death will soon come and plant them over again! You certainly know that",
            "every person has his or her life's tree or flower, just as everyone happens to be settled; they look like other plants, but they have pulsations of the heart. Children's hearts can also beat; go after yours, perhaps you may know your child's; but what",
            "will you give me if I tell you what you shall do more?\" \"I have nothing to give,\" said the afflicted mother, \"but I will go to the world's end for you!\" \"Nay, I have nothing to do there!\" said the woman. \"But you can give me your long black hair; you",
            "know yourself that it is fine, and that I like! You shall have my white hair instead, and that's always something!\" \"Do you demand nothing else?\" said she. \"That I will gladly give you!\" And she gave her her fine black hair, and got the old woman's",
            "snow-white hair instead. So they went into Death's great greenhouse, where flowers and trees grew strangely into one another. There stood fine hyacinths under glass bells, and there stood strong-stemmed peonies; there grew water plants, some",
            "so fresh, others half sick, the water-snakes lay down on them, and black crabs pinched their stalks. There stood beautiful palm-trees, oaks, and plantains; there stood parsley and flowering thyme: every tree and every flower had",
            "its name; each of them was a human life, the human frame still lived--one in China, and another in Greenland--round about in the world. There were large trees in small pots, so that they stood so stunted in growth, and ready to burst the pots; in other",
            "places, there was a little dull flower in rich mould, with moss round about it, and it was so petted and nursed. But the distressed mother bent down over all the smallest plants, and heard within them how the human heart beat; and amongst millions she",
            "knew her child's. \"There it is!\" cried she, and stretched her hands out over a little blue crocus, that hung quite sickly on one side. \"Don't touch the flower!\" said the old woman. \"But place yourself here, and when Death comes--I expect him every",
            "moment--do not let him pluck the flower up, but threaten him that you will do the same with the others. Then he will be afraid! He is responsible for them to OUR LORD, and no one dares to pluck them up before HE gives leave.\" All at once an icy cold",
            "rushed through the great hall, and the blind mother could feel that it was Death that came. \"How hast thou been able to find thy way hither?\" he asked. \"How couldst thou come quicker than I?\" \"I am a mother,\" said she. And Death stretched out his long",
            "hand towards the fine little flower, but she held her hands fast around his, so tight, and yet afraid that she should touch one of the leaves. Then Death blew on her hands, and she felt that it was colder than the cold wind, and her hands fell down",
            "powerless. \"Thou canst not do anything against me!\" said Death. \"But OUR LORD can!\" said she. \"I only do His bidding!\" said Death. \"I am His gardener, I take all His flowers and trees, and plant them out in the great garden of Paradise, in the unknown",
            "land; but how they grow there, and how it is there I dare not tell thee.\" \"Give me back my child!\" said the mother, and she wept and prayed. At once she seized hold of two beautiful flowers close by, with each hand, and cried out to Death, \"I will tear",
            "all thy flowers off, for I am in despair.\" \"Touch them not!\" said Death. \"Thou say'st that thou art so unhappy, and now thou wilt make another mother equally unhappy.\" \"Another mother!\" said the poor woman, and directly let go her hold of both",
            "the flowers. \"There, thou hast thine eyes,\" said Death; \"I fished them up from the lake, they shone so bright; I knew not they were thine. Take them again, they are now brighter than before; now look down into the deep well close by; I shall tell thee",
            "the names of the two flowers thou wouldst have torn up, and thou wilt see their whole future life--their whole human existence: and see what thou wast about to disturb and destroy.\" And she looked down into the well; and it was a happiness to see",
            "how the one became a blessing to the world, to see how much happiness and joy were felt everywhere. And she saw the other's life, and it was sorrow and distress, horror, and wretchedness. \"Both of them are God's will!\" said Death. \"Which of them is",
            "Misfortune's flower and which is that of Happiness?\" asked she. \"That I will not tell thee,\" said Death; \"but this thou shalt know from me, that the one flower was thy own child! it was thy child's fate thou saw'st--thy own child's future life!\" Then",
            "the mother screamed with terror, \"Which of them was my child? Tell it me! Save the innocent! Save my child from all that misery! Rather take it away! Take it into God's kingdom! Forget my tears, forget my prayers, and all that I have done!\" \"I do not",
            "understand thee!\" said Death. \"Wilt thou have thy child again, or shall I go with it there, where thou dost not know!\" Then the mother wrung her hands, fell on her knees, and prayed to our Lord: \"Oh, hear me not when I pray against Thy will, which is",
            "the best! hear me not! hear me not!\" And she bowed her head down in her lap, and Death took her child and went with it into the unknown land."

            "There was once a poor Prince, who had a kingdom. His kingdom was very small, but still quite large enough to marry upon; and he wished to marry. It was certainly rather cool of him to say to the Emperor's daughter, \"Will you have me?\" But so",
            "he did; for his name was renowned far and wide; and there were a hundred princesses who would have answered, \"Yes!\" and \"Thank you kindly.\" We shall see what this princess said. Listen! It happened that where the Prince's father lay buried, there",
            "grew a rose tree--a most beautiful rose tree, which blossomed only once in every five years, and even then bore only one flower, but that was a rose! It smelt so sweet that all cares and sorrows were forgotten by him who inhaled its fragrance. And",
            "furthermore, the Prince had a nightingale, who could sing in such a manner that it seemed as though all sweet melodies dwelt in her little throat. So the Princess was to have the rose, and the nightingale; and they were accordingly put into large silver",
            "caskets, and sent to her. The Emperor had them brought into a large hall, where the Princess was playing at \"Visiting,\" with the ladies of the court; and when she saw the caskets with the presents, she clapped her hands for joy. \"Ah, if it were but a",
            "little pussy-cat!\" said she; but the rose tree, with its beautiful rose came to view. \"Oh, how prettily it is made!\" said all the court ladies. \"It is more than pretty,\" said the Emperor, \"it is charming!\" But the Princess touched it, and was almost",
            "ready to cry. \"Fie, papa!\" said she. \"It is not made at all, it is natural!\" \"Let us see what is in the other casket, before we get into a bad humor,\" said the Emperor. So the nightingale came forth and sang so delightfully that at first no one could",
            "say anything ill-humored of her. \"Superbe! Charmant!\" exclaimed the ladies; for they all used to chatter French, each one worse than her neighbor. \"How much the bird reminds me of the musical box that belonged to our blessed Empress,\" said an old",
            "knight. \"Oh yes! These are the same tones, the same execution.\" \"Yes! yes!\" said the Emperor, and he wept like a child at the remembrance. \"I will still hope that it is not a real bird,\" said the Princess. \"Yes, it is a real bird,\" said those who had",
            "brought it. \"Well then let the bird fly,\" said the Princess; and she positively refused to see the Prince. However, he was not to be discouraged; he daubed his face over brown and black; pulled his cap over his ears, and knocked at the door. \"Good day",
            "to my lord, the Emperor!\" said he. \"Can I have employment at the palace?\" \"Why, yes,\" said the Emperor. \"I want some one to take care of the pigs, for we have a great many of them.\" So the Prince was appointed \"Imperial Swineherd.\" He had a dirty",
            "little room close by the pigsty; and there he sat the whole day, and worked. By the evening he had made a pretty little kitchen-pot. Little bells were hung all round it; and when the pot was boiling, these bells tinkled in the most charming manner, and",
            "played the old melody, \"Ach! du lieber Augustin, Alles ist weg, weg, weg!\"* * \"Ah! dear Augustine! All is gone, gone, gone!\" But what was still more curious, whoever held his finger in the smoke of the kitchen-pot, immediately smelt all the dishes that",
            "were cooking on every hearth in the city--this, you see, was something quite different from the rose. Now the Princess happened to walk that way; and when she heard the tune, she stood quite still, and seemed pleased; for she could play \"Lieber",
            "Augustine\"; it was the only piece she knew; and she played it with one finger. \"Why there is my piece,\" said the Princess. \"That swineherd must certainly have been well educated! Go in and ask him the price of the instrument.\" So one of the court-ladies",
            "must run in; however, she drew on wooden slippers first. \"What will you take for the kitchen-pot?\" said the lady. \"I will have ten kisses from the Princess,\" said the swineherd. \"Yes, indeed!\" said the lady. \"I cannot sell it for less,\" rejoined the",
            "swineherd. \"He is an impudent fellow!\" said the Princess, and she walked on; but when she had gone a little way, the bells tinkled so prettily \"Ach! du lieber Augustin, Alles ist weg, weg, weg!\" \"Stay,\" said the Princess. \"Ask him if he will have ten",
            "kisses from the ladies of my court.\" \"No, thank you!\" said the swineherd. \"Ten kisses from the Princess, or I keep the kitchen-pot myself.\" \"That must not be, either!\" said the Princess. \"But do you all stand before me that no one may see us.\" And the",
            "court-ladies placed themselves in front of her, and spread out their dresses--the swineherd got ten kisses, and the Princess--the kitchen-pot. That was delightful! The pot was boiling the whole evening, and the whole of the",
            "following day. They knew perfectly well what was cooking at every fire throughout the city, from the chamberlain's to the cobbler's; the court-ladies danced and clapped their hands. \"We know who has soup, and who has pancakes for",
            "dinner to-day, who has cutlets, and who has eggs. How interesting!\" \"Yes, but keep my secret, for I am an Emperor's daughter.\" The swineherd--that is to say--the Prince, for no one knew that he was other than an ill-favored swineherd, let not",
            "a day pass without working at something; he at last constructed a rattle, which, when it was swung round, played all the waltzes and jig tunes, which have ever been heard since the creation of the world. \"Ah, that is superbe!\" said the",
            "Princess when she passed by. \"I have never heard prettier compositions! Go in and ask him the price of the instrument; but mind, he shall have no more kisses!\" \"He will have a hundred kisses from the Princess!\" said the lady who had been to ask. \"I",
            "think he is not in his right senses!\" said the Princess, and walked on, but when she had gone a little way, she stopped again. \"One must encourage art,\" said she, \"I am the Emperor's daughter. Tell him he shall, as on yesterday, have ten kisses from me,",
            "and may take the rest from the ladies of the court.\" \"Oh--but we should not like that at all!\" said they. \"What are you muttering?\" asked the Princess. \"If I can kiss him, surely you can. Remember that you owe everything to me.\" So the ladies were",
            "obliged to go to him again. \"A hundred kisses from the Princess,\" said he, \"or else let everyone keep his own!\" \"Stand round!\" said she; and all the ladies stood round her whilst the kissing was going on. \"What can be the reason for such a crowd close",
            "by the pigsty?\" said the Emperor, who happened just then to step out on the balcony; he rubbed his eyes, and put on his spectacles. \"They are the ladies of the court; I must go down and see what they are about!\" So he pulled up his slippers at the heel,",
            "for he had trodden them down. As soon as he had got into the court-yard, he moved very softly, and the ladies were so much engrossed with counting the kisses, that all might go on fairly, that they did not perceive the Emperor. He rose on his tiptoes.",
            "\"What is all this?\" said he, when he saw what was going on, and he boxed the Princess's ears with his slipper, just as the swineherd was taking the eighty-sixth kiss. \"March out!\" said the Emperor, for he was very angry; and both Princess and swineherd",
            "were thrust out of the city. The Princess now stood and wept, the swineherd scolded, and the rain poured down. \"Alas! Unhappy creature that I am!\" said the Princess. \"If I had but married the handsome young Prince! Ah! how unfortunate I am!\"",
            "And the swineherd went behind a tree, washed the black and brown color from his face, threw off his dirty clothes, and stepped forth in his princely robes; he looked so noble that the Princess could not help bowing before him. \"I am come to despise",
            "thee,\" said he. \"Thou would'st not have an honorable Prince! Thou could'st not prize the rose and the nightingale, but thou wast ready to kiss the swineherd for the sake of a trumpery plaything. Thou art rightly served.\" He then went back to his",
            "own little kingdom, and shut the door of his palace in her face. Now she might well sing, \"Ach! du lieber Augustin, Alles ist weg, weg, weg!\""
