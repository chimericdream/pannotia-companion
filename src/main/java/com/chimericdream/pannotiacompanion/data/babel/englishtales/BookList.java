            "was very hungry, and she brought him to her house in the wood, where he served her for a twelvemonths and a day. When the year had passed, she called him to her, and said she had good wages for him. So she presented him with an ass out of the",
            "stable, and he had but to pull Neddy's ears to make him begin at once to ee--aw! And when he brayed there dropped from his mouth silver sixpences, and half crowns, and golden guineas. The lad was well pleased with the wage he had received, and",
            "away he rode till he reached an inn. There he ordered the best of everything, and when the innkeeper refused to serve him without being paid beforehand, the boy went off to the stable, pulled the ass's ears and obtained his",
            "pocket full of money. The host had watched all this through a crack in the door, and when night came on he put an ass of his own for the precious Neddy of the poor youth. So Jack without knowing that any change had been made, rode away next morning to",
            "his father's house. Now, I must tell you that near his home dwelt a poor widow with an only daughter. The lad and the maiden were fast friends and true loves; but when Jack asked his father's leave to marry the girl, \"Never till you have the money to",
            "keep her,\" was the reply. \"I have that, father,\" said the lad, and going to the ass he pulled its long ears; well, he pulled, and he pulled, till one of them came off in his hands; but Neddy, though he hee-hawed and he hee-hawed let fall no half crowns",
            "or guineas. The father picked up a hay-fork and beat his son out of the house. I promise you he ran. Ah! he ran and ran till he came bang against the door, and burst it open, and there he was in a joiner's shop. \"You're a likely lad,\" said the joiner;",
            "\"serve me for a twelvemonths and a day and I will pay you well.'\" So he agreed, and served the carpenter for a year and a day. \"Now,\" said the master, \"I will give you your wage;\" and he presented him with a table, telling him he had but to say, \"Table,",
            "be covered,\" and at once it would be spread with lots to eat and drink. Jack hitched the table on his back, and away he went with it till he came to the inn. \"Well, host,\" shouted he, \"my dinner to-day, and that of the best.\" \"Very sorry, but there is",
            "nothing in the house but ham and eggs.\" \"Ham and eggs for me!\" exclaimed Jack. \"I can do better than that.-- Come, my table, be covered!\" At once the table was spread with turkey and sausages, roast mutton, potatoes, and greens. The publican opened his",
            "eyes, but he said nothing, not he. That night he fetched down from his attic a table very like that of Jack, and exchanged the two. Jack, none the wiser, next morning hitched the worthless table on to his back and carried it home. \"Now, father, may I",
            "marry my lass?\" he asked. \"Not unless you can keep her,\" replied the father. \"Look here!\" exclaimed Jack. \"Father, I have a table which does all my bidding.\" \"Let me see it,\" said the old man. The lad set it in the middle of the room, and bade it",
            "be covered; but all in vain, the table remained bare. In a rage, the father caught the warming-pan down from the wall and warmed his son's back with it so that the boy fled howling from the house, and ran and ran till he came to a river and",
            "tumbled in. A man picked him out and bade him assist him in making a bridge over the river; and how do you think he was doing it? Why, by casting a tree across; so Jack climbed up to the top of the tree and threw his weight on it, so that when the man",
            "had rooted the tree up, Jack and the tree-head dropped on the farther bank. \"Thank you,\" said the man; \"and now for what you have done I will pay you;\" so saying, he tore a branch from the tree, and fettled it up into a club with his knife. \"There,\"",
            "exclaimed he; \"take this stick, and when you say to it, 'Up stick and bang him,' it will knock any one down who angers you.\" The lad was overjoyed to get this stick--so away he went with it to the inn, and as soon as the publican, appeared, \"Up stick",
            "and bang him!\" was his cry. At the word the cudgel flew from his hand and battered the old publican on the back, rapped his head, bruised his arms tickled his ribs, till he fell groaning on the floor; still the stick belaboured the prostrate man, nor",
            "would Jack call it off till he had got back the stolen ass and table. Then he galloped home on the ass, with the table on his shoulders, and the stick in his hand. When he arrived there he found his father was dead, so he brought his ass into the",
            "stable, and pulled its ears till he had filled the manger with money. It was soon known through the town that Jack had returned rolling in wealth, and accordingly all the girls in the place set their caps at him. \"Now,\" said Jack, \"I shall marry the",
            "richest lass in the place; so tomorrow do you all come in front of my house with your money in your aprons.\" Next morning the street was full of girls with aprons held out, and gold and silver in them; but Jack's own sweetheart was among them, and",
            "she had neither gold nor silver, nought but two copper pennies, that was all she had. \"Stand aside, lass;\" said Jack to her, speaking roughly. \"Thou hast no silver nor gold--stand off from the rest.\" She obeyed, and the tears ran down",
            "her cheeks, and filled her apron with diamonds. \"Up stick and bang them!\" exclaimed Jack; whereupon the cudgel leaped up, and running along the line of girls, knocked them all on the heads and left them senseless on the pavement. Jack took all their",
            "money and poured it into his truelove's lap. \"Now, lass,\" he exclaimed, \"thou art the richest, and I shall marry thee.\""

            "you don't know what these beans are,\" said the man; \"if you plant them over-night, by morning they grow right up to the sky.\" \"Really?\" says Jack; \"you don't say so.\" \"Yes, that is so, and if it doesn't turn out to be true you can have your cow back.\"",
            "\"Right,\" says Jack, and hands him over Milky-white's halter and pockets the beans. Back goes Jack home, and as he hadn't gone very far it wasn't dusk by the time he got to his door. \"What back, Jack?\" said his mother; \"I see you haven't got Milky-",
            "white, so you've sold her. How much did you get for her?\" \"You'll never guess, mother,\" says Jack. \"No, you don't say so. Good boy! Five pounds, ten, fifteen, no, it can't be twenty.\" \"I told you you couldn't guess, what do you say to these beans;",
            "they're magical, plant them over-night and----\" \"What!\" says Jack's mother, \"have you been such a fool, such a dolt, such an idiot, as to give away my Milky-white, the best milker in the parish, and prime beef to boot, for a set of paltry beans.",
            "Take that! Take that! Take that! And as for your precious beans here they go out of the window. And now off with you to bed. Not a sup shall you drink, and not a bit shall you swallow this very night.\" So Jack went upstairs to his little room in the",

            "dark and shady. So Jack jumped up and dressed himself and went to the window. And what do you think he saw? why, the beans his mother had thrown out of the window into the garden, had sprung up into a big beanstalk which went up and up and up",
            "till it reached the sky. So the man spoke truth after all. The beanstalk grew up quite close past Jack's window, so all he had to do was to open it and give a jump on to the beanstalk which was made like a big plaited ladder. So Jack climbed and he",
            "climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till at last he reached the sky. And when he got there he found a long broad road going as straight as a dart. So he walked along and he walked along and he walked along",
            "till he came to a great big tall house, and on the doorstep there was a great big tall woman. \"Good morning, mum,\" says Jack, quite polite-like. \"Could you be so kind as to give me some breakfast.\" For he hadn't had anything to eat, you know, the night",
            "before and was as hungry as a hunter. \"It's breakfast you want, is it?\" says the great big tall woman, \"it's breakfast you'll be if you don't move off from here. My man is an ogre and there's nothing he likes better than boys broiled on toast. You'd",
            "better be moving on or he'll soon be coming.\" \"Oh! please mum, do give me something to eat, mum. I've had nothing to eat since yesterday morning, really and truly, mum,\" says Jack. \"I may as well be broiled, as die of hunger.\" Well, the",
            "ogre's wife wasn't such a bad sort, after all. So she took Jack into the kitchen, and gave him a junk of bread and cheese and a jug of milk. But Jack hadn't half finished these when thump! thump! thump! the whole house began to tremble with the noise",
            "of someone coming. \"Goodness gracious me! It's my old man,\" said the ogre's wife, \"what on earth shall I do? Here, come quick and jump in here.\" And she bundled Jack into the oven just as the ogre came in. He was a big one, to be sure. At his belt he",
            "had three calves strung up by the heels, and he unhooked them and threw them down on the table and said: \"Here, wife, broil me a couple of these for breakfast. Ah what's this I smell? Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman, Be he",
            "alive, or be he dead, I'll have his bones to grind my bread.\" \"Nonsense, dear,\" said his wife, \"you're dreaming. Or perhaps you smell the scraps of that little boy you liked so much for yesterday's dinner. Here, go you and have a wash and tidy up, and",
            "by the time you come back your breakfast'll be ready for you.\" So the ogre went off, and Jack was just going to jump out of the oven and run off when the woman told him not. \"Wait till he's asleep,\" says she; \"he always has a snooze after breakfast.\"",
            "Well, the ogre had his breakfast, and after that he goes to a big chest and takes out of it a couple of bags of gold and sits down counting them till at last his head began to nod and he began to snore till the whole house shook again. Then Jack crept",
            "out on tiptoe from his oven, and as he was passing the ogre he took one of the bags of gold under his arm, and off he pelters till he came to the beanstalk, and then he threw down the bag of gold which of course fell in to his mother's garden, and then",
            "he climbed down and climbed down till at last he got home and told his mother and showed her the gold and said: \"Well, mother, wasn't I right about the beans. They are really magical, you see.\" So they lived on the bag of gold for some time, but at last",
            "they came to the end of that so Jack made up his mind to try his luck once more up at the top of the beanstalk. So one fine morning he got up early, and got on to the beanstalk, and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he",
            "climbed and he climbed till at last he got on the road again and came to the great big tall house he had been to before. There, sure enough, was the great big tall woman a-standing on the door-step. \"Good morning, mum,\" says Jack, as bold as",
            "brass, \"could you be so good as to give me something to eat?\" \"Go away, my boy,\" said the big, tall woman, \"or else my man will eat you up for breakfast. But aren't you the youngster who came here once before? Do you know, that very day, my man missed",
            "one of his bags of gold.\" \"That's strange, mum,\" says Jack, \"I dare say I could tell you something about that but I'm so hungry I can't speak till I've had something to eat.\" Well the big tall woman was that curious that she took him in and gave him",
            "something to eat. But he had scarcely begun munching it as slowly as he could when thump! thump! thump! they heard the giant's footstep, and his wife hid Jack away in the oven. All happened as it did before. In came the ogre as he did before, said:",
            "\"Fee-fi-fo-fum,\" and had his breakfast off three broiled oxen. Then he said: \"Wife, bring me the hen that lays the golden eggs.\" So she brought it, and the ogre said: \"Lay,\" and it laid an egg all of gold. And then the ogre began to nod his head, and to",
            "snore till the house shook. Then Jack crept out of the oven on tiptoe and caught hold of the golden hen, and was off before you could say \"Jack Robinson.\" But this time the hen gave a cackle which woke the ogre, and just as Jack got out of the house he",
            "heard him calling: \"Wife, wife, what have you done with my golden hen?\" And the wife said: \"Why, my dear?\" But that was all Jack heard, for he rushed off to the beanstalk and climbed down like a house on fire. And when he got home he showed his mother",
            "the wonderful hen and said \"Lay,\" to it; and it laid a golden egg every time he said \"Lay.\" Well, Jack was not content, and it wasn't very long before he determined to have another try at his luck up there at the top of the beanstalk. So one fine",
            "morning, he got up early, and went on to the beanstalk, and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till he got to the top. But this time he knew better than to go straight to the ogre's house. And when he got near it he waited behind a",
            "bush till he saw the ogre's wife come out with a pail to get some water, and then he crept into the house and got into the copper. He hadn't been there long when he heard thump! thump! thump! as before, and in come the ogre and his wife. \"Fee-fi-fo-fum,",
            "I smell the blood of an Englishman,\" cried out the ogre; \"I smell him, wife, I smell him.\" \"Do you, my dearie?\" says the ogre's wife. \"Then if it's that little rogue that stole your gold and the hen that laid the golden eggs he's sure to have got into",
            "the oven.\" And they both rushed to the oven. But Jack wasn't there, luckily, and the ogre's wife said: \"There you are again with your fee-fi-fo-fum. Why of course it's the laddie you caught last night that I've broiled for your breakfast. How",
            "forgetful I am, and how careless you are not to tell the difference between a live un and a dead un.\" So the ogre sat down to the breakfast and ate it, but every now and then he would mutter: \"Well, I could have sworn----\" and he'd get up and search",
            "the larder and the cupboards, and everything, only luckily he didn't think of the copper. After breakfast was over, the ogre called out: \"Wife, wife, bring me my golden harp.\" So she brought it and put it on the table before him. Then he said: \"Sing!\"",
            "and the golden harp sang most beautifully. And it went on singing till the ogre fell asleep, and commenced to snore like thunder. Then Jack lifted up the copper-lid very quietly and got down like a mouse and crept on hands and knees till he got to",
            "the table when he got up and caught hold of the golden harp and dashed with it towards the door. But the harp called out quite loud: \"Master! Master!\" and the ogre woke up just in time to see Jack running off with his harp. Jack ran as fast as he",
            "could, and the ogre came rushing after, and would soon have caught him only Jack had a start and dodged him a bit and knew where he was going. When he got to the beanstalk the ogre was not more than twenty yards away when suddenly he saw Jack",
            "disappear like, and when he got up to the end of the road he saw Jack underneath climbing down for dear life. Well, the ogre didn't like trusting himself to such a ladder, and he stood and waited, so Jack got another start. But just then the harp cried",
            "out: \"Master! master!\" and the ogre swung himself down on to the beanstalk which shook with his weight. Down climbs Jack, and after him climbed the ogre. By this time Jack had climbed down and climbed down and climbed down till he was very nearly home.",
            "So he called out: \"Mother! mother! bring me an axe, bring me an axe.\" And his mother came rushing out with the axe in her hand, but when she came to the beanstalk she stood stock still with fright for there she saw the ogre just coming down below the",

            "beanstalk was cut in two and began to topple over. Then the ogre fell down and broke his crown, and the beanstalk came toppling after. Then Jack showed his mother his golden harp, and what with showing that and selling the golden eggs, Jack and his",

            "Kate gave him a bite of the birdie, and he rose up on his elbow. By-and-by he cried out again: \"Oh, if I had another bite of that birdie!\" so Kate gave him another bite, and he sat up on his bed. Then he said again: \"Oh! if I only had a third bite of",

            "his way.\" \"And don't you have anything else but boy-meat? No pudding?\" asked Tommy. \"Ah, I loves pudding,\" says Mrs. Miacca. \"But it's not often the likes of me gets pudding.\" \"Why, my mother is making a pudding this very day,\" said Tommy Grimes, \"and I",
            "am sure she'd give you some, if I ask her. Shall I run and get some?\" \"Now, that's a thoughtful boy,\" said Mrs. Miacca, \"only don't be long and be sure to be back for supper.\" So off Tommy pelters, and right glad he was to get off so cheap; and for",
            "many a long day he was as good as good could be, and never went round the corner of the street. But he couldn't always be good; and one day he went round the corner, and as luck would have it, he hadn't scarcely got round it when Mr.",

            "supper. Well, you shan't do it again. I'll watch over you myself. Here, get under the sofa, and I'll set on it and watch the pot boil for you.\" So poor Tommy Grimes had to creep under the sofa, and Mr. Miacca sat on it and waited for the pot to boil.",
            "And they waited, and they waited, but still the pot didn't boil, till at last Mr. Miacca got tired of waiting, and he said: \"Here, you under there, I'm not going to wait any longer; put out your leg, and I'll stop your giving us the slip.\" So Tommy put",
            "out a leg, and Mr. Miacca got a chopper, and chopped it off, and pops it in the pot. Suddenly he calls out: \"Sally, my dear, Sally!\" and nobody answered. So he went into the next room to look out for Mrs. Miacca, and while he was there, Tommy",

            "Mr. Vinegar said: \"My love, I will climb up into a tree, drag up the door, and you shall follow.\" He accordingly did so, and they both stretched their weary limbs on the door, and fell fast asleep. In the middle of the night Mr. Vinegar was",
            "disturbed by the sound of voices underneath, and to his horror and dismay found that it was a band of thieves met to divide their booty. \"Here, Jack,\" said one, \"here's five pounds for you; here, Bill, here's ten pounds for you; here, Bob, here's",

            "instead of pocketing pence, the boys followed him hooting, laughing, and pelting. Poor Mr. Vinegar, his fingers grew very cold, and, just as he was leaving the town, he met a man with a fine thick pair of gloves. \"Oh, my fingers are so very cold,\" said",

            "to pick it up, the little Pig jumped down and ran home. The next day the Wolf came again, and said to the little Pig, \"Little Pig, there is a Fair in the Town this afternoon: will you go?\" \"Oh, yes,\" said the Pig, \"I will go; what time shall you be",
            "ready?\" \"At three,\" said the Wolf. So the little Pig went off before the time, as usual, and got to the Fair, and bought a butter churn, and was on his way home with it when he saw the Wolf coming. Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into the",
            "churn to hide, and in doing so turned it round, and it began to roll, and rolled down the hill with the Pig inside it, which frightened the Wolf so much that he ran home without going to the Fair. He went to the little Pig's house, and told him how",
            "frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him. Then the little Pig said, \"Hah! I frightened you, did I? I had been to the Fair and bought a butter churn, and when I saw you I got into it, and rolled down the hill.\" Then",
            "the Wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he would eat up the little Pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him. When the little Pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as the Wolf",

            "cried as if her heart would break. Suddenly she heard a croaking voice, and she looked up and saw a great frog with goggle eyes looking at her and speaking to her. \"What's the matter, dearie?\" it said. \"Oh, dear, oh dear,\" she said, \"my stepmother has",
            "sent me all this long way to fill this sieve with water from the Well of the World's End, and I can't fill it no how at all.\" \"Well,\" said the frog, \"if you promise me to do whatever I bid you for a whole night long, I'll tell you how to fill it.\" So",
            "the girl agreed, and then the frog said: \"Stop it with moss and daub it with clay, And then it will carry the water away;\" and then it gave a hop, skip and jump, and went flop into the Well of the World's End. So the girl looked about for some moss, and",
            "lined the bottom of the sieve with it, and over that she put some clay, and then she dipped it once again into the Well of the World's End; and this time, the water didn't run out, and she turned to go away. Just then the frog popped up its head out of",
            "the Well of the World's End, and said: \"Remember your promise.\" \"All right,\" said the girl; for thought she, \"what harm can a frog do me?\" So she went back to her stepmother, and brought the sieve full of water from the Well of the World's End. The",
            "stepmother was fine and angry, but she said nothing at all. That very evening they heard something tap tapping at the door low down, and a voice cried out: \"Open the door, my hinny, my heart, Open the door, my own darling; Mind you the words that you",
            "and I spoke, Down in the meadow, at the World's End Well.\" \"Whatever can that be?\" cried out the stepmother, and the girl had to tell her all about it, and what she had promised the frog. \"Girls must keep their promises,\" said the stepmother. \"Go and",
            "open the door this instant.\" For she was glad the girl would have to obey a nasty frog. So the girl went and opened the door, and there was the frog from the Well of the World's End. And it hopped, and it skipped, and it jumped, till it reached the",
            "girl, and then it said: \"Lift me to your knee, my hinny, my heart; Lift me to your knee, my own darling; Remember the words you and I spoke, Down in the meadow by the World's End Well.\" But the girl didn't like to, till her stepmother said \"Lift it up",
            "this instant, you hussy! Girls must keep their promises!\" So at last she lifted the frog up on to her lap, and it lay there for a time, till at last it said: \"Give me some supper, my hinny, my heart, Give me some supper, my darling; Remember the words",
            "you and I spake, In the meadow, by the Well of the World's End.\" Well, she didn't mind doing that, so she got it a bowl of milk and bread, and fed it well. And when the frog, had finished, it said: \"Go with me to bed, my hinny, my heart, Go with me to",
            "bed, my own darling; Mind you the words you spake to me, Down by the cold well, so weary.\" But that the girl wouldn't do, till her stepmother said: \"Do what you promised, girl; girls must keep their promises. Do what you're bid, or out you go, you and",
            "your froggie.\" So the girl took the frog with her to bed, and kept it as far away from her as she could. Well, just as the day was beginning to break what should the frog say but: \"Chop off my head, my hinny, my heart, Chop off my head, my own darling;",
            "Remember the promise you made to me, Down by the cold well so weary.\" At first the girl wouldn't, for she thought of what the frog had done for her at the Well of the World's End. But when the frog said the words over again, she went and took an axe and",
            "chopped off its head, and lo! and behold, there stood before her a handsome young prince, who told her that he had been enchanted by a wicked magician, and he could never be unspelled till some girl would do his bidding for a whole night, and chop",
            "off his head at the end of it. The stepmother was that surprised when she found the young prince instead of the nasty frog, and she wasn't best pleased, you may be sure, when the prince told her that he was going to marry her stepdaughter",
            "because she had unspelled him. So they were married and went away to live in the castle of the king, his father, and all the stepmother had to console her was, that it was all through her that her stepdaughter was married to a prince."
